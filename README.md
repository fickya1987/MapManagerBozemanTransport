# MapManagerBozemanTranspot
A Streamlit app to manage and process route data. This app takes in a processed csv from google maps data to create an interactive interface to build visually pleasing point-to-point maps. This project is an Office of Student Engagement program to support student visits explore Bozeman and learn about our free public transit. This web app is built in conjunction with physical documents.
